# SimpleWeather is a small app I downloaded to experiment on it.

### To go to the original repository go to https://reactjsexample.com/a-simple-weather-app-using-react-and-redux/.

I downloaded this app to experiment on it as a project for the bootcamp upgrade-hub.
I added a small detail (local time and the option to switch it from 12h to 24h format).
Thanks to this I was introduced to Redux implementation in a react project.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/keyofevergreen/SimpleWeather.git
```

2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`. The command will start a local live server. Open (http://localhost:3000/SimpleWeather) in your browser, if the tab doesn't open automatically.
