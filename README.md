# üå§SimpleWeather is a small SPA I do as a pet project.
### So it's still in development.

Hello! This is my first SPA using a combination of React and Redux.\
It implements the loading of data from API of [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)\
I also used the [MUI library](https://mui.com/) for buttons and a [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) to navigate through the pages.


## How to use
### üê±‚ÄçüèçGo to the [gh-pages](https://keyofevergreen.github.io/SimpleWeather/)!
### Or

1. You need to register at [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and get an API key (Note that the request has all the checkboxes next to the fields in the tab "API Response Fields").
2. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/keyofevergreen/SimpleWeather.git
```
3. Go to the cloned directory (e.g. `cd SimpleWeather`).
4. Add the API key to the ".env.example" file
5. Run `npm install`.
6. Run `npm start`. The command will start a local live server. Open (http://localhost:3000/SimpleWeather) in your browser, if the tab doesn't open automatically.

### I would be glad to have any code review on your part :)
